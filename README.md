# simplerpg
simplerpg is a simple 2D open world game made in Python as a learning experience with pyglet and 2D games.

## Disclaimer
I'd like to make it clear that this project isn't meant to be a polished, released game that you'd pay for. This is my learning project that I'm using to learn Python, pyglet and the core aspects of game development, so a lot of the code will come off very inefficient or not well done.

While I appreciate and greatly encourage PRs and improvements, please don't send over simple fixes like naming patterns. These are mistakes I'll learn to fix myself.

## Install
Installing and running simplerpg is real easy. Clone (or download) the source code and extract it to a suitable location.

simplerpg depends on pyglet and opensimplex to run. Install them both within the location you extracted.
```
pip install pyglet
pip install opensimplex
```

Finally, run main.py to start the game.
```
py main.py
```

If you're on Windows, there's an included run.bat file for easier access.

## Gameplay
### Controls
W - Move up
A - Move left
S - Move down
D - Move right

ESC - Quit

### World
When you first load the game, you'll see an empty, green world. That's pretty much it for now. I'll update this as the world gets the love and attention it needs.

## Contributing
Want to contribute to simplerpg? There's a couple ways to do so:
- If you're a developer, improvements and major changes are always welcomed. I'd appreciate if you have some sort of prior experience with pyglet to avoid any mishaps, but if it's just a general Python issue that's fine. Make sure to take a look at pre-existing code to see how it's styled and organized.
- Know a different language? Translations for the game would be real great. As of right now there's not much actual language in the game, but when there is, that's when there'll be lots of work to do.
- If you're just an average player, that's okay. Tracking down bugs and reporting them is a great way to help, as well as getting involved with the game's discussion here on GitHub, sharing it to your friends and family, or even a small donation if you like it that much. 

- If there's something else you're thinking about, shoot me an email at [thattonybo@gmail.com](mailto:thattonybo@gmail.com) or message me on Discord at ThatTonybo#0001.
